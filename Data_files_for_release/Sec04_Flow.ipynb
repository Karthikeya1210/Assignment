    "In the previous section, we saw how we could use `dict`s to execute code under certain conditions.  This can be very useful, but probably the most readable way of executing code based on the outcome of a test is to use Python's `if` construct.  We could have written the test in the previous task in the following way:\n",

    "```python\n",
    "if (y == 0) and (x > 10):\n",
    "    print('Messiah')\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print('Very naughty boy')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at this in more detail.  We start the `if` statement with a line that says\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if <test>:\n",
    "```\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-warning\" style=\"width: 60%; margin-left: 20%; margin-top:20px\">\n",

    "<p>**IMPORTANT!**</p>\n",
    "<p>While indentation is a common convention when programming in any language, in Python this is actually forced - it is built into the languge as the way that the code blocks are defined. It is not optional! This makes for very clean-looking code compared to other languages that have IF...ENDIF, FOR...ENDFOR statements or braces '{}' surrounding the code blocks. On the other hand, it can be irritating if you are using a text editor that does not automatically indent the cursor for you when you press return. Pick your text editors wisely! It is conventional to use 4 spaces as each 'unit' of indentation - not tabs.</p>\n",

    "We could have finished the `if` statement after the `print 'Messiah'` line.  However, have also included an `else` statement, which executes if the condition `<test>` evaluates to `False`.  We can also chain `if` statements together using the `elif` form. Try putting different values of x in the following cell:"
